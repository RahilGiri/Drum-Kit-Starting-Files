This is a Drum Kit web application that allows users to play sounds by pressing keys on the keyboard or by clicking on the drum pad icons. The application is designed to emulate a real drum kit, with various drum sounds corresponding to different keys and clickable drum pad elements.

Features
	•	Interactive Drum Pads: Each drum pad is mapped to a specific key on the keyboard. Clicking on a drum pad or pressing the corresponding key will play a sound.
	•	Sound Feedback: Each drum sound is accompanied by a visual effect (animation) that highlights the drum pad when triggered.
	•	Responsive UI: The design adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across desktop and mobile devices.

Tech Stack
	•	HTML: Used for structuring the drum kit interface with clickable pads.
	•	CSS: Styles the layout, buttons, and animations, ensuring a clean and engaging UI.
	•	JavaScript: Powers the interactivity, allowing users to trigger sounds by either pressing keys or clicking on the drum pads. It also includes event handling for the animations.

How to Play
	1.	Click on Drum Pads: Click any of the drum pads on the screen to hear the sound.
	2.	Use Keyboard Keys: Press the designated keyboard keys (e.g., A, S, D, F, G) to trigger the sounds of the corresponding drum pads.
